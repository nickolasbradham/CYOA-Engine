Yes I know it's jank AF. Too bad!

# Choose Your Own Adventure Engine
## This program is designed to make creating CYOA type stories easy.

The engine can load `.coa` text files which are just text files with the extension changed.

You can see `Example Story.coa` for a brief example of the majority of what this engine provides in action.

## General COA File Flow
The file is parsed from top to bottom a line at a time. If a line starts with a command token (see farther down for commands), the command is executed.
If no command token is present (or it's escaped with `\` at the start), the line is just sent to the text area for the player.

The program will wait for reader interaction if it reaches a `>w` command (see that command for more details) or if the end of the file is reached. 

Text displayed to the reader can contain a variable (more on them in the next section) name surrounded by `<` and `>` to insert a variable value in the text.

In the following example `>h` is the command token for a header and the rest of the line is processed differently (see farther down for that command), but the next two lines will just be sent to the text area.
```
>h Chapter 1: <name> Awakens...
You wake up in what appears to be an old rusty cell. Sun light filters through the tiny windows from outside the cell.
It is quiet and you don't see anyone around.
```
Empty lines are ignore. If you wish to put a line break in your story text just include a space on that, otherwise empty, line.

## Variables
Variables can also affect the flow of the story. There are three main vairable types: Flags, Numbers, and Strings

`Flags` are simple in that they exist or don't exist. They don't store data.

`Numbers` can contain a number that can be operated on or compared.

`Strings` sadly have very limitted use. You can take input from the reader, display strings, and test equality on them.

## Expressions
Some commands can take expressions. These take the form of `[!]<flag>` or `<varA><comparison><val | varB>`. Do note there is no space between variables and ops.

`<flag>` will return true if "flag" exists.

`!<flag>` will return true if "flag" does NOT exist.

**Comparisons:**

`=` Equal

`!` NOT equal

`<` Less than

`[` Less than OR equal to

`>` Greater than

`]` Greater than OR equal to

## Commands
### `>c` Clear
Clears the text area.

### `>cf` Clear Flags/Variables
Deletes all story flags and variables.

### `>f <name> [value]` Create Flag/Variable
`[value]` is parsed to the end of the line (i.e. it can have spaces).

Creates a flag wth name `<name>` if `[value]` is not supplied.

Creates a Number if `[value]` contains a number.

Creates a String containing `[value]` if previous case is not met.

**Examples:**

`>f tookKeys` will create a flag labeled "tookKeys".

`>f bullets 3` will create a number variable named "bullets" and set it to 3.

`>f secret Best secret password` will create a String variable named "secret" and set it to "Best secret password".

### `>f <nameA><op><nameB | val>` Perform variable operation.
Performs `<op>` on `<nameA>` and `<nameB | val>`. Then stores result in `<nameA>`. Do note that there is no space between the names and operator.

**Operators:**

`+` Addition

`-` Substraction

`*` Multiplication

`/` Division

`%` Remainder

`:` Copy (Copies the value of `<nameB | val>` into `<nameA>`)

**Examples:**

`>f bullets-1` will subtract 1 from variable "bullets".

`>f cash+money` will add variable "money" to variable "cash".

`>f before:message` will copy variable "message" into variable "before".

### `>fd <name>` Delete Flag/Variable
Deletes flag/variable `<name>`.

**Examples:**

`>fd tookKeys` would delete the "tookKeys" flag.

### `>h <text>` Set Header
Sets the header text to `<text>`.

`<text>` is parsed to the end of the line (i.e. it can have spaces) and it can have variables inserted in it.

**Examples:**

`>h Chapter 1: <name> Awakens!` would set the header text to "Chapter 1: Nick Awakens!" assuming there was variable "name" that had the text "Nick" stored in it.

### `>i <name> <prompt>` Get input from the reader.
Displays a input text box to the reader with `<prompt>` displayed. The input will be stored in variable `<name>`.

`<prompt>` is parsed to the end of the line (i.e. it can have spaces) and it can have variables inserted in it.

**Examples:**

`>i reader What is your name?` Would prompt "What is your name?" and store the input in the variable "reader"

### `>j <label>` Jump to label
Jumps story to next label `<label>` or loops to start of story and checks again.

This is used in conjunction with `>l` (see that command) to jump to different story places.

**Examples:**

`>j ending1` Jumps the story to label "ending1"

### `>jf <expression> <label>` Jump if expression is true
If `<expression>` is true, jumps story to next label `<label>` or loops to start of story and checks again.

This is used in conjunction with `>l` (see that command) to jump to different story places.

**Examples:**

`>jf key unlockDoor` If flag "key" exists, jumps the story to label "unlockDoor".

`>jf !cutPower startMachine` If flag "cutPower" does NOT exist, jumps the story to label "startMachine".

`>jf timeWaited>3 tooLate` If variable "timeWaited" is greater than 3, jumps the story to label "tooLate".

### `>l <label>` Story label
Defines a label to jump to.

**Note:** Be careful if you use "next" as a label. `>j` and `>jf` can use "next" as a valid label, but `>o` and `>of` can NOT use it because they use that keyword to continue where the engine left off.

Used in conjunction with `>j`, `>jf`, `>o`, and `>of` (see those commands) to jump to different story places.

**Examples:**

`>l ending1` Defines label "ending1" for jumping to.

### `>o <label | "next"> <text>` Create button
Creates a button with text `<text>` and that, when clicked, jumps the story to `<label>`. Using the `next` keyword just tells the engine to continue where it is.

`<text>` is parsed to the end of the line (i.e. it can have spaces) and it can have variables inserted in it.

**Examples:**

`>o upLadder Climb the ladder.` Creates a button with text "Climb the ladder." that jumps to label "upLadder".

`>o next Insert <count> quarters.` Creates a button with text "Insert 3 quarters" (assuming variable "count" is 3) that continues right where the engine last stopped.

### `>of <expression> <label | "next"> <text>` Create button if expression is true
If `<expression>` is true, creates a button with text `<text>` and that, when clicked, jumps the story to `<label>`. Using the `next` keyword just tells the engine to continue where it is.

`<text>` is parsed to the end of the line (i.e. it can have spaces).

**Examples:**

`of carFueled driveAway Drive away.` If flag "carFueled" exists, create button with text "Drive away." that jumps to label "driveAway".

`of !cutPower next Start machine.` If flag "cutPower" does NOT exist, create button with text "Start machine." that that continues right where the engine last stopped.

`of snacks>0 eatSnack Eat a snack.` If variable "snacks" is greater than zero, create button with text "Eat a snack." that jumps to label "eatSnack".

### `>r <name> <min> <max>` Pick random integer
Chooses a random integer in range [`<min>`, `<max>`) and stores it in variable `<name>`.

**Examples:**

`>r hoursSlept 2 5` will pick 2, 3, or 4 at random and store it in variable "hoursSlept".

### `>tf <expression> <text>` Display text if expression is true
If `<expression>` is true,  Displays `<text>`.

`<text>` is parsed to the end of the line (i.e. it can have spaces) and it can have variables inserted in it.

**Examples:**

`>tf sawPassword You remembered their password was "best secret" from earlier.` If flag "sawPassword" exists, displays "You remembered their password was "best secret" from earlier."

`>tf !tookKeys You realize you forgot your keys and go back to get them.` If flag "tookKeys" does NOT exist, displays "You realize you forgot your keys and go back to get them."

`>tf waits>1 You have waited <waits> times.` If variable "waits" is greater than one, displays You have waited 2 times." (assuming that waits is two).

### `>w` Wait for reader interaction.
Causes the engine to halt execution until the reader does something.

Most common use case is after a block of buttons so the reader can make a choice.
